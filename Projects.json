 "description": "<strong>Note:</strong> This is an internal client project developed under <strong>EnPointe.io</strong> during my internship, so I can't share the preview or GitHub links publicly. However, I’ve attached screenshots for reference.<br><br> <strong>YRF-HRMS</strong> is a custom Human Resource Management System built for a leading film production company to digitize and simplify their internal HR processes. The platform streamlines tasks such as employee onboarding, leave applications, announcements, form workflows, and access-controlled dashboards across various roles including employees, managers, and HR administrators.<br><br> The system replaces inefficient manual operations with an end-to-end digital workflow, supporting real-time status tracking, application histories, approval chains, and detailed insights—helping the organization operate with greater clarity and efficiency.<br><br> I was solely responsible for developing the entire backend of this project, which included designing the database schema, building a robust API architecture, implementing business logic, handling complex role-based access flows, and ensuring data consistency and security across the system.<br><br> This project reflects my ability to deliver production-grade backend systems that solve real business problems through thoughtful architecture and clean, scalable code.",
